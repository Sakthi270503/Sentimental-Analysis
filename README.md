Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of movie reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative). Each review is represented as a piece of text, and the task is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, and converting words to lowercase to prepare it for analysis.

Feature Extraction: The text data is transformed into numerical feature vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique, which captures the importance of words in the documents.

Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed and feature-engineered data to learn the underlying patterns in the movie reviews and make predictions about their sentiment.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions.

Results
The trained logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 83% on the sentiment analysis task. The model demonstrates balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-score for both positive and negative classes.

Next Steps
Further Optimization: Explore additional optimization techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or advanced feature engineering to improve model performance.

Error Analysis: Conduct a detailed analysis of misclassified examples to identify patterns and areas for improvement in the model.

Deployment: Consider deploying the trained model in real-world applications for sentiment analysis tasks, such as sentiment monitoring in customer reviews or social media comments.

Usage
